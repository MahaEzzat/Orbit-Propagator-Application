# Orbit-Propagator-Application <br />
Description: <br />
It is an mission trajectory propagator which can find the optimal path between two planets. <br />
<br />
This program has three working modes: <br />
•	Mode (1) : <br />
Takes the input from the user (whether in the form of 6 orbital elements, TLE, or initial R and V) to plot the orbit and animate the motion of the satellite. <br />
•	Mode (2) : <br />
Takes the time at which the user wants to calculate the position and velocity (after taking the initial input from mode (1)) and calculates them. <br />
•	Mode (3) : <br />
Is the interplanetary transformation:  the user chooses the destination planet (Mars or Venus) and enters the radii of both parking orbits then the program generates a 3d animation of the interplanetary transformation. <br />
